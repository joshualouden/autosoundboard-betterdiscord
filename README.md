# AutoSoundboard BetterDiscord plugin repo
**⚠️ A Stream Deck is required for this plugin to work.**  
This extension allows you to play soundboards automatically when you join a Discord voice channel without having a nitro subscription.  
With that I am also accepting PR's for new services and also updates to the current ones.  
If you are submitting PR's try and keep names and titles the same.
